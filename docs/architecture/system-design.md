# System Design

## 1. Overview

Verdyx is organized around an API gateway fronting multiple domain services. The gateway handles auth, request shaping, and route orchestration while domain services own business logic and persistence boundaries.

## 2. Core Components

### API Gateway

Responsibilities:
- JWT-based auth and request middleware.
- Public and protected route groups under `/api/v1`.
- Delegation to analysis, bounty, reputation, submission, wallet, and webhook handlers.

### Domain Services

- User Service: identity/profile/auth workflows.
- Analysis Engine: scanning and enrichment pipeline.
- Bounty Manager: bounty lifecycle and on-chain integration.
- Submission Service: analyst submissions and vote/verify workflows.
- Consensus Service: aggregation and decisioning.
- Payment Service: payout and treasury transactions.
- Reputation Service: score computation and leaderboard.
- Notification Service: outbound notification channels.

## 3. Storage and State

### PostgreSQL

Use cases:
- User, bounty, submission, payment, and reputation records.
- Transactional consistency and queryable history.

### Redis

Use cases:
- Session and token-adjacent caching.
- Rate limiting support.
- Lightweight event fan-out patterns.

### Object Storage (MinIO/S3)

Use cases:
- Uploaded artifacts and large binary payloads.

## 4. Security Boundaries

- Public endpoints: auth and health routes.
- Mixed endpoints: read routes often public, write routes protected.
- Protected endpoints: user/wallet/submission/webhook domains.
- Service-to-service trust anchored in network policy plus secrets.

## 5. Blockchain Integration

Gateway and bounty/payment domains consume configured chain RPC and contract addresses:
- Bounty Manager contract
- Threat Token contract
- Reputation System contract

Configuration is environment-driven via TOML and `.env` templates under `config/`.

## 6. Deployment Shapes

- Local dev: `docker-compose.dev.yml` (core dependencies).
- Full local stack: `docker-compose.yml`.
- Cluster rollout: manifests in `infrastructure/kubernetes`.
